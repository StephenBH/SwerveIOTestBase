# SwerveIO Test Base
A demo swerve drive base that uses [SwerveIO](https://git.bancino.net/?p=robotics/SwerveIO.git), a powerful swerve drive library. This is the official repository of our practice base, which currently runs the SwerveDriveSpecialties MK2 Module kit. It is also a great introduction to SwerveIO and it goes to show just how little you have to do to actually incorporate SwerveIO into your robot code.

## Contributing
This repository is a demo of the latest version of SwerveIO. It really isn't intended to be a mainstream project, but I could see it becoming a template for teams that are starting fresh and want to use SwerveIO. If you find any issues with this project, open an issue or send us a pull request.

You can view the SwerveIO user documentation <a href="https://javadoc.bancino.net/SwerveIO/latest">here</a> if needed.
